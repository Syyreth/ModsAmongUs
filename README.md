# Crewmate Roles:
## V.I.P
**Inspiration from Town of Salem**<br/>
The V.I.P is an important crewmate role which needs to be kept alive in order for crewmates to win. If the V.I.P ever dies, the Impostors win, and everyone else loses. All the crewmates will know the identity of the impostor from the start, whereas Impostors and Neutrals will be left unknown to the information. The goal of the crew is to win the game whilst keeping the V.I.P alive.

## Captain
**Inspiration from Town of Salem**<br/>
The Captain is an unknown player who plays the game as a normal Crewmate. In meetings, they can reveal themselves to every other player in the game, allowing their voting power to be multiplied, and having every vote they do count more. However once a Captain is revealed, they cannot fix non-essential sabotages (Lights/Comms) and they are unable to protected by the Guardian.

## Investigator
The Investigator is a task based role, and on completion of their tasks, they will be able to investigate the faction of any player. However, if the player is Neutral or Impostor, they will also see who the Investigator is. If the Investigator investigates an Angel, and their target is an Impostor, the Angel will also show as an Impostor. Likewise if they are a crewmate, the Angel will also show as a crewmate. The Investigator also gets false readings from Neutral roles. If they investigate the Executioners target, it will display the same reading as an executioner. If they investigate a doused player, it will give the same reading as an Arsonist, and if they investigate and infected player, it will give the same reading as the Plaguebearer.
