The goal of the crew is to win the game whilst keeping the V.I.P alive.

The Investigator also gets false readings from Neutral roles. If they investigate the Executioners target, it will display the same reading as an executioner. If they investigate a doused player, it will give the same reading as an Arsonist, and if they investigate and infected player, it will give the same reading as the Plaguebearer.
