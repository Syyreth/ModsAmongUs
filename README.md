# Crewmate Roles:
## V.I.P
**Inspiration from Town of Salem**<br/>
The V.I.P is an important crewmate role which needs to be kept alive in order for crewmates to win. If the V.I.P ever dies, the Impostors win, and everyone else loses. All the crewmates will know the identity of the impostor from the start, whereas Impostors and Neutrals will be left unknown to the information. The goal of the crew is to win the game whilst keeping the V.I.P alive.

## Captain
**Inspiration from Town of Salem**<br/>
The Captain is an unknown player who plays the game as a normal Crewmate. In meetings, they can reveal themselves to every other player in the game, allowing their voting power to be tripled, and having every vote they do count as 3. However once a Captain is revealed, they cannot fix non-essential sabotages (Lights/Comms) and they are unable to protected by the Guardian.

## Vigilante
**Inspiration from Town of Salem and assistance from the Woodi-Sherrif Mod**<br/>
The Vigilante is a crewmate which is capable of killing any other player in the game. Their duty is to kill all the impostors. If they accidentally kill a crewmate, they will kill the player and alongside it, kill themselves.

## Guardian
**Inspiration from Ottomated's Mod**<br/>
The Guardian is a crewmate role who can protect any player they wish for 10 seconds. In those 10 seconds, any attack towards the player is negated, and their shield will be broken. Any player that tried to attack them will have their ability put back on cooldown, but it will have had no effect.

## Investigator
The Investigator is a task based role, and on completion of their tasks, they will be able to investigate the faction of any player. However, if the player is Neutral or Impostor, they will also see who the Investigator is. If the Investigator investigates an Angel, and their target is an Impostor, the Angel will also show as an Impostor. Likewise if they are a crewmate, the Angel will also show as a crewmate. The Investigator also gets false readings from Neutral roles. If they investigate the Executioners target, it will display the same reading as an executioner. If they investigate a doused player, it will give the same reading as an Arsonist, and if they investigate and infected player, it will give the same reading as the Plaguebearer.

## Swapper
**Inspiration from TownOfUs Mod**<br/>
The Swapper is a role which activates in meetings. The Swapper can swap around 2 votes of any players and change who potentially gets voted out. However, if none of the Swapper's targets gets voted out, then the 2 players will switch bodies for the next round, changing how they look and their name. Once the next meeting starts, they will change place.

## Chronos
**Inspiration from the TownOfUs's Time Lord**<br/>
The Chronos is a crewmate which has the ability to rewind time by 3 seconds. Once the Chronos rewinds time, the players will work their way back to where they were 3 seconds ago, and any players who died during the 3 seconds will be ressurected. All abilities will keep their cooldown, and will not be reset from the rewind.

At LEAST 1 of those 2 people will be crew, it could either be 1, or both.

If the impostor dies, the Arsonist will still be around and have a chance to win. If the Arsonist and the Impostor are in a 1v1 scenario, the Impostor will be granted victory.'

## Ghoul
The Ghoul is a neutral role who's ability gets granted after death. Once a Ghoul dies, all the players around them will be the same colour and have the same name, so the Ghoul cannot differentiate them. Once the lights are switched off, the Ghoul is able to see the names of each person. Each round, the Ghoul will be able to haunt as many players as there are impostors in the game, resetting every meeting. If the Ghoul manages to successfully haunt all the impostors in 1 round, the Ghoul will win.

## Plaguebearer
**Based off Town of Salem**<br/>
The Plaguebearer is a neutral role who is able to infect other players. Each round, the Plaguebearer can infect as many alive people they have infected previously, starting off with 1 Infect in the first round. If an infected player dies, the Plaguebearer will get 1 less opportunity to infect a player. Once everyone in the game has been infected, the Plaguebearer becomes the Pestillence, the Horseman of the Apocalypse and is able to kill players with a 3 second cooldown. If the impostor dies, the Plaguebearer/Pestillence will remain until the end. In a 1v1 situation between the Plaguebearer and the Impostor, the Impostor will win, however in a 1v1 situation between the Pestillence and the Impostor, the Pestillence will win instead.

## Angel
**Based off Town of Salem**<br/>
The Angel is a neutral role which aligns with the faction of their target, whether they are Impostor or Crewmate. Their main purpose is to keep their target alive. They can only protect their target twice in the whole game, once in a meeting, and once in the game. When a player is protected in the game, they will receive a 60 second immunity which doesn't break until after the time is up. When a player is protected in the meeting, they are safe from getting voted out, and getting murdered by the Arsonist. The Angel will win with whatever faction their target is in, as long as their target remains alive at the end of the game.

**Based off Town of Salem**<br/>
The Serial Killer is a neutral role which can murder players alongside the Impostors, but are working against them. The Serial Killer has its own win condition of being alive until the end. In a 1v1 situation against the Impostors, the Serial Killer will win, and they will keep going if the Impostor gets voted out in the middle of the game.

## Impostor Roles
## Janitor
**Based off Town of Salem**<br/>
The Janitor is an impostor role which also has the ability to remove a body from the game. The Clean ability and the Kill button share a cooldown, meaning if one ability is used, both will go on cooldown, so the impostor can choose if they want to clean a body, or kill a player.

## Morpher
**Based off The Morphling from Ottomated's Mod**<br/>
The Morpher is a role which can sample any player in a game. After a certain amount of time, they can transform into the sampled player and imitate them for a short period of time. However the Morpher cannot vent.

## Spy
The Spy is a role which can place down a camera anywhere in the map which can ONLY be seen by Impostors. The placing button shares the same cooldown as the kill button so at the start of a round, the impostor must choose if they want to play first or kill first. Each impostor will then get access to view button and can access the Camera to see what's going on. If the Spy remains alone in Admin for 60 seconds in total (not consecutively), they can then Bug the Admin Map, giving each Impostor Remote access through their sabotage map.

## Flashbang
**Based of Grenadier from the Submarine Mod**<br/>
The Flashbang is a role which can flash players around them for 3 seconds. If a player is flashed, their screen will fade to white and remain like that for 3 seconds before fading back to normal. The Flashbang will also be flashed, but they can use this to perform sneaky kills in the game.
